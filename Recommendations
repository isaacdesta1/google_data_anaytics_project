Promotional approach based on the total number of rides by bike type for casual users

* For Casual Riders: Marketing strategies could emphasize the benefits of casual use, promoting the ease of access to docked bikes and the availability of electric bikes for more comfortable rides. Ensuring that docked bikes are placed in high-traffic areas could further attract casual users.
* Provide Flexibility: Address concerns about commitment by offering flexible membership plans, such as monthly or quarterly options, rather than just annual subscriptions. Highlight the ease of upgrading or downgrading plans based on usage patterns.
* Educate on Usage Patterns: Use data insights (similar to those in the analysis) to educate casual users on the potential savings and benefits of switching to membership, particularly if they tend to take longer rides or use the service during peak times.
* Provide more classic bikes in different locations to attract casual users to use the service more often so that eventually they become members.
