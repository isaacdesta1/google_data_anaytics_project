Provide Flexibility: Address concerns about commitment by offering flexible membership plans, such as monthly or quarterly options, rather than just annual subscriptions. It reassures potential and existing users that they can easily change thier membership plans as thier needs evolve.

Since there is a higher usage of classic bike, providing more classic bikes in different locations attracts casual users to use the service more often so that eventually become members.

Given the significant decline in bike usage among casual users during the fall and winter, I recommend initiating marketing efforts in the spring, specifically starting from the month of May and continuing them throughout the summer.
